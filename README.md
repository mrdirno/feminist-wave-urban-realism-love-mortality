## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character's profession (like masonry or art conservation) becomes a metaphor for their approach to a failing relationship.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of a city (like Brooklyn) observing the small, mortal lives within it.
- Write a dialogue between two friends where one is a 'death doula' and the other is terrified of aging, set during a mundane task like grocery shopping.
- Describe a character discovering a small, personal artifact (a letter, a drawing) that changes their understanding of a historical figure or event they thought they knew.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Decay Simulator' that visually and textually degrades a piece of text or an image based on variables like time, material, and environmental factors, reflecting the novel's themes.
- Create an interactive map of a fictional or real neighborhood where each building/landmark contains a 'memory' or story tied to themes of preservation, loss, and urban history.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Virginia Woolf (for stream-of-consciousness interiority & feminist critique), James Baldwin (for urban realism & searing emotional truth), Joan Didion (for cool, precise observation of mortality & social anxiety), Haruki Murakami (for weaving the mundane with the metaphysical & themes of quiet loneliness)
